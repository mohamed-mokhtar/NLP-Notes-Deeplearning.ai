# NLP-Notes-Deeplearning.ai
My own notes For Natural Language Processing Specialization by deeplearning.ai [VISIT!](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)  
It will contain also another resources for NLP aka BIG-NLP  
Hello there.  
Like to share my experience and notes as well as a review for the new NLP specialization on Coursera.  
I have finished first course of it and i will update this repository incrementally.  
### 1- Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces [VISIT!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp)  
I have included its labs in the first folder C01 directory in the repository it contains each week's labs W0X as a Jupyter Notebook files.

### 2- Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models [VISIT!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp)

## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.


## Prerequisite
