# Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
## C01
- a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
- b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
- c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

<b>Problem definition</b> : you have an input vector X aka feature vector and to this input you have a corresponding label or output for this features.  
e.g in Problems at CF/HackerRank, you have samples of inputs and its outputs to help you figure the pattern you need to solve it.  
So far the following context was about the <b>Supervised learning</b> and you are trying now to get the best fit for the mapping between [X] and [Y] vectors.  
<b>How to solve it?</b>  
The best mapping between those vectors you need to minimize the difference between the true labels or vector [Y} and your outcome from input features [X}  
for example you have built your outcome function f(x) = ....   
you apply it on you [X] vectors and get output. the output you get we will compare it with the real output or true labels [Y].
lets call the f(x)= ... output is [Y_pred] and the real output we know before already is [Y] as it was no changes.  
the solution is to minimize the difference between |Y_pred - Y} to make them nearly close to each other.  
To solve it we need to find a function to measure the distance or difference between those two vectors or two outputs, this function is called cost function/loss.  
<b>Types of problems</b> We have two kinds of problems in Supervised learning   
1) Classification . absolute output and expected e.g. one of a list of known outputs  
e.g. at Sentiment analysis you need to classify "Twitter tweet" is it positive or negative?  
e.g. is this picture for a cat or no?  
1- Logistic regression classifier / Logistic classification   
2) Regression
